# This is checklist for a Scout Lead to follow before a competition

It is the lead scouts responsibility to insure that all scouting tablets and computers are ready for the competition. This means that all are charged, that all are running the correct version of ScoutEyeEX (make sure that the correct name of the game is displayed on the screen [for 2024 it would be **Crescendo**]), that the QR scanner can connect and correctly scans data into a spreadsheet, that the scouting computer is running LibreOffice Calc, that the QR code scanner is connected to the scouting computer, and that the QR code scanner is switched on.

Approximately a week before a competition the lead scout should make sure that all scouts are aware of the competition and that they are available to scout. The lead scout should also make sure that all scouts have a scouting device (team Android tablet or personal Windows computer) and that the scouting device is charged and setup.

ScoutEyeEX **must be tested** before the competition. This means that the lead scout must make sure that the QR code scanner can connect to the scouting computer and that the QR code scanner can scan data into a spreadsheet, that all team tablets are running the correct version of ScoutEyeEX, and that the scouting computer is running LibreOffice Calc. It is also in there best interest to scout a few matches to insure the entire system is working correctly. 

Verify that all data fills in correctly and that the cursor correctly preforms a carriage return after each scan. All data are in the correct columns and rows and that no data is missing. It is also critical that they test to confirm that both Android and Windows devices can scan data into the spreadsheet and both output are the in agreement.

Approximately 30 minutes before the competition begins the lead scout should make sure that all scouts are present and ready to scout. The lead scout should also make sure that all scouts have a charged and setup scouting device (team Android tablet or personal Windows computer), and that the scouting schedule is known, clear, and that all scouts are aware of it.
